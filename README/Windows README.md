# Windows games

## Phantom joystick direction repeats
If you are using a USB zero delay encoder, you may experience repeated joystick presses once you launch a game.  i.e. when you trigger down or right, the emulator keeps receiving inputs in that direction (symptom is in game menus just scroll indefinitely or characters are just going in one direction in game).  

I found the problem is in the generated SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG environment variable, inspected by WINE to check what controller movements are supported.  When "dpad" directions (dpup, dpdown, dpleft, dpright) are added for zero delay encoder type controllers, this causes the repeat problem.  I also found Batocera was not generating the required "leftx:a0,lefty:a1" which meant the joysticks weren't working at all in other windows games.

My solution was to edit the:
```
/usr/lib/python3.11/site-packages/configgen/generators/wine/wineGenerator.py
/usr/lib/python3.11/site-packages/configgen/generators/controller.py
```

scripts so that I could configure which systems / games to skip dpad settings or add leftx/lefty.

If your controller is named:
`DragonRise Inc.   Generic   USB  Joystick  `  

then the prefix in the batocera.conf would be:  
`dragonrise`  
i.e. first word  

You can find your controller name by launching (then exiting) any of your windows games then opening:
`/userdata/system/logs/es_launch_stdout.log`  

and finding the line with:  
`SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG=03000000790000000600000010010000,DragonRise Inc.   Generic   USB  Joystick  ,platform:Linux,b:b4,a:b3,lefttrigger:b6,leftstick:b10,rightshoulder:b5,leftshoulder:b2,righttrigger:b7,y:b1,x:b0,start:b9,back:b8,leftx:a0,lefty:a1,`  

You can add the following lines to:  
`/userdata/system/batocera.conf`  

`<system>["<game>"].<your_controller_name>_skip_dpad=true`  
Will cause the dpad entries to be skipped when generating the config (fixing phantom joystick movements)
and  
`<system>["<game>"].<your_controller_name>_add_leftx=true`  
Will cause the leftx entries to be added (enabling joystick movement)  

Here's my settings, preventing dpad entry on just broforce but ensuring leftx/lefty is added for all Windows games:  
```
windows["Broforce.wine"].dragonrise_skip_dpad=true
windows.dragonrise_add_leftx=true
```
