# Cabinet design
The design was done in Sketchup 7 and is available [here](https://github.com/DaveBullet1050/BatoceraHelpers/blob/main/image/Cocktail%20cabinet%20model%20-%20v12a%20-%20upright%20with%20marque%20-%20sketchup%20v7.skp) as well as block layout for sides [here](https://github.com/DaveBullet1050/BatoceraHelpers/blob/main/image/Cocktail%20cabinet%20model%20-%20v12a%20-%20blocking.skp) and side panel dimensions [here](https://github.com/DaveBullet1050/BatoceraHelpers/blob/main/image/Cocktail%20cabinet%20model%20-%20v12%20-%20side%20panels.skp).  

Note: the sketchup model is pretty basic.  There's no advanced concepts of grouping lines etc.. into components. I mainly use sketchup for exact dimensions and checking for angles, interference, positioning etc... before committing to cuts.  This isn't the kind of model you send to a CNC machine!

## Features
- Side by side 2 player cabinet with storage at bottom via 2 hinged doors (just big enough to hold a Logitech FBB wheel (G923 model) and pedals 
- Cabinet access from rear
- Removable monitor panel.  Takes a 27" LCD widescreen monitor

- Rear mounted fans - inlet and exhaust with separate on/off rocker switch
- Overall "power on / off" switch (rear of cabinet)
- Flip down control panel access panel (underneath)
- Removable control panel (screwed from underneath)
- Coin acceptor (see [this](https://github.com/DaveBullet1050/BatoceraHelpers/blob/main/README/CoinAcceptor%20README.md) for wiring details
- Various hotkeys, for amplifier volume (up/down), pause emulator, fastforward and rewind, open in emulator virtual keyboard (e.g.for VICE), config menus - details [here](https://github.com/DaveBullet1050/BatoceraHelpers/blob/main/image/Button%20mapping.ods)

## Control panel details
See the mockup panel [here](https://github.com/DaveBullet1050/BatoceraHelpers/blob/main/README/Controller%20Reference%20README.md#physical-layout).  

- Sanwa joysticks with 6 buttons per player, plus per player coin and start buttons
- Joysticks mounted underside for removal or future upgrade
- Separate PC power on/off pushbutton (wired to the left button of a sacrificial mouse, connected to the PC's "power on" USB port)

- Spinner (Thunderstick.com ultra USB)
- All buttons (apart from power off/on) connected to a Dragonwise USB zero delay encoder (one per player)
- Two USB ports (front mounted) for plugging in a wheel, keyboard/mouse or extra controllers (for 4 player games)
