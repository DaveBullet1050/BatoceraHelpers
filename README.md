# Batocera Helpers
A bunch of config or how to scripts / info for a Batocera gaming machine.  All of this was running successfully on v39 on a Raspberry Pi 3B+.  Therefore some may not work on a later version of Batocera or on another architecture (e.g. x86).  
This repo contains my batocera overlay file plus other config / scripts (under /userdata).  The help pages below link to the relevant files for configuring that feature.
