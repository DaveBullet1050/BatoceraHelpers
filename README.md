# Batocera Helpers
A bunch of config or how to scripts / info for a Batocera gaming machine.  All of this was running successfully on v39 on a Raspberry Pi 3B+.  Therefore some may not work on a later version of Batocera or on another architecture (e.g. x86).  

There are no ROMS included in this repo for obvious legal and copyright reasons.  Also the advice I'm giving is on my own account and has not been endorsed by the devs at Batocera (infact they may likely object to much of it!).  So please use at your own risk.  I've included it here as it may help you with any problems you are having (at least understand where things are done and have examples to look at).  Any changes to any Batocera supplied scripts or code can be thought of as sub-optimal hacks, either working around my lack of detailed configuration knowledge or a specific feature that doesn't exist that I wanted to add.

As with any system, before you apply any of these changes, do a backup!  You can do this via plugging in a USB stick formatted to exFAT, the via the main ES menu: System Settings -> Backup User Data (Target Device = should show your USB stick) -> Start.

This repo contains my batocera overlay file (expanded into the directories and files you see) plus other config / scripts (under /userdata).  The help pages below link to the relevant files for configuring that feature.
